				<b>Manchester United are reportedly concerned that Paul Pogba’s injury could keep him out until after the international break in November.</b>
				<p>
					The France international has been out for the last three weeks with a hamstring problem, ending what had been a fine start to the season for him in United’s midfield.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pogba only joined the Red Devils last summer for what was then a world-record £89million, and was starting to show his true potential after taking time to fully adjust to the Premier League. However, United now fear Pogba’s injury could be worse than initially expected as they weigh up whether or not the 24-year-old should undergo surgery.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the Daily Telegraph, the club fear he is looking doubtful to return in time for the Chelsea game on November 5, with November 18 a more realistic target. Jose Mourinho will be comforted by the form of midfielders Nemanja Matic and Marouane Fellaini so far this season, while he also has Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick as backup options. United certainly don’t seem to be desperately missing Pogba at the moment with Romelu Lukaku’s goals firing the team to success game after game, but the club won’t want to be without their record signing for too long.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is concern that Pogba’s injury is similar to the one suffered by Barcelona forward Ousmane Dembele, who has been ruled out for three months. They are reported to have consulted Sakari Orava, a Finnish muscle repair specialist, about the injury but still remain unclear about how long Pogba will be out for.

				<b>Manchester United are back, says Red Devils legend Roy Keane.</b>
				<p>
					The Red Devils have been scoring for fun in both the Premier League and Champions League, with Romelu Lukaku particularly catching Keane’s eye with his great impact since joining in the summer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Keane played for some of United’s most dominant sides under Sir Alex Ferguson, so knows a thing or two about what it takes to win football’s most prestigious honours. Despite a difficult few years for the club since Ferguson’s retirement in 2013, their former skipper is now expecting big things from them again this term.
				</p>
				<p>
					‘United are back,’ Keane told ITV. ‘They look like they could be ready to win the big trophies, whereas over the last year or two you look at them and thing they might win a League Cup or the so-called lesser trophies. ‘They are back now competing and you would expect United to be in the latter stages of the Champions League and you would expect them to be competing to win the Premier League.’ Singling Lukaku out for praise, the Irishman also described the £75million signing as a ‘bargain’ who will score 25-30 goals a season for the side.
				</p>
				<p>
					‘He is a good player at a good age. He knows the Premier League. He was a bargain at £75m, it was obvious he was going to score goals,’ Keane added. ‘His record at Everton was fantastic and clearly he has gone to a bigger club and better team, who will create so many chances for him, he will get 25-30 goals a season.''

				<b>Ex-Manchester United chairman insists Alan Shearer said he 'wanted to go to Man Utd'</b>
				<p>
					Former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards insists that Alan Shearer told Sir Alex Ferguson he wanted to join the Red Devils.
					Shearer left Blackburn Rovers in the wake of Euro 1996, but it was hometown club Newcastle United he moved to, rather than Old Trafford.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pogba only joined the Red Devils last summer for what was then a world-record £89million, and was starting to show his true potential after taking time to fully adjust to the Premier League. However, United now fear Pogba’s injury could be worse than initially expected as they weigh up whether or not the 24-year-old should undergo surgery.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the Magpies paid a world-record transfer fee of £15m to bring Shearer home, the rest, as they say, was history. Shearer became a club legend, smashing the club’s and the Premier League’s goalscoring records.

					But Edwards says that, rather than Shearer preferring Newcastle over Manchester United, it was Blackburn chairman Jack Walker who blocked a move to the North West.

					Edwards told TalkSport: “Alan Shearer was close, I did the deal with Stevens his agent. He told Alex (Ferguson) he wanted to come.

					“I think the problem there was Jack Walker, Jack Walker didn’t want him to come to United.

					“He was happy for him to go to Newcastle, yeah. Jack Walker was almost ‘over my dead body’, so he didn’t come.”

					Shearer has often been berated for his decision to join Newcastle, with Manchester United going on to win numerous Premier League titles as well as the treble in 1999.

					But the legendary number 9 has always insisted he has no regrets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, Edwards has also discussed the Red Devils almost signing another Geordie legend.
					He said: “
					Obviously people talk about Gascoigne.
					“We nearly had him, we thought we got him and in the end he went to Tottenham.”

				<b>Manchester United face being without SIX key players for weekend match against Crystal Palace</b>
				<p>
					The France international has been out for the last three weeks with a hamstring problem, ending what had been a fine start to the season for him in United’s midfield.Manchester United are facing being without SIX key players for their match against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday.

					The Red Devils hammered CSKA Moscow 4-1 in Russia on Wednesday night, but Anthony Martial, who scored and assisted Romelu Lukaku twice, limped off in the second half, although he is expected to be fit.
				,</p>
				<p>
					United travelled to Russia without Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini and Phil Jones, as well as Antonio Valencia, although it is believed the Ecuadorian was rested for the trip, report the Manchester Evening News.

					Paul Pogba is out until next month at the earliest with a hamstring injury, while Marcos Rojo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are continuing to recover from their long-term knee injuries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mourinho gave a succinct update on United's injury situation but did not clarify how serious Martial's knock was.

					"Carrick has no chance," Mourinho told BT Sport. "I think Jones I have many doubts. And Fellaini I have a hope, just a hope."

					United captain Carrick has made just one appearance this season in the Carabao Cup but Fellaini started the last two Premier League matches and was named man of the match in the opening Champions League win over Basel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Southampton striker Shane Long crudely tackled Fellaini during the first-half of United's weekend win but the Belgian played the remainder of the match.

					Mourinho revealed Jones, who was named man of the match on the south coast, was playing with an ankle problem last month and the England centre half has not figured in any of United's midweek matches this season.

					United switched to a back three against CSKA Moscow following the spate of injuries and Victor Lindelof could make his Premier League debut if he is retained against basement club Palace.
